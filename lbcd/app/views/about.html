	<ol>
		<li>Build bridges between ongoing work on biodiversity and cultural diversity.</li>
		<li>Promote synergies and information sharing among already existing programmes, projects and activities.</li>
		<li>Further explore conceptual and methodological issues related to the links between biological and cultural diversity and the role of indigenous peoples and local communities in enhancing those links.</li>
		<li>Promote the collection, compilation and analysis of information from on-the ground activities linking biological and cultural diversity from, among others, biosphere reserves and World Heritage sites, and from the experiences provided by indigenous peoples and local communities.</li>
		<li>Support and foster learning networks on bio-cultural approaches, linking grassroots and community initiatives with local, national, regional and global policy processes.</li>

	<h2>INFORMAL DIVERSITY LIAISON GROUP</h2>
	<p>The main objective of the informal Liaison Group on Biological and Cultural Diversity (DLG) is to provide technical advice in view of assisting the Secretariats of CBD and UNESCO in advancing the Joint Programme, assessing the progress made and providing guidance for next steps.</p>
	<p>The members of the DLG were invited by CBD Executive Secretary and UNESCO Assistant Director General for Natural Sciences to participate in the liaison group, based on expertise, ability to contribute to the deeper understanding of the interface between biological and cultural diversity, taking into account gender considerations and geographic balance.</p>
	<p>The group is meeting on an ad-hoc basis, subject to the availability of funding, as well as electronically.</p>
	<p>The first meeting of DLG was held in New York in April 2012. The <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/cop/cop-11/information/cop-11-inf-11-en.pdf">report</a> was considered by CBD COP 11 resulting in Decision (check with JOHN).</p>
